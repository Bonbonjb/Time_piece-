Time-Series Forecasting of Amazon Stock Prices using LSTM

Introduction
This project aims to build and evaluate a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model to forecast Amazon's stock prices. 
LSTM models are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for sequence prediction problems due to their ability to learn long-term dependencies.
